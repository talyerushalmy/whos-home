## Features

- 🏠 **Real-time device tracking** - Know who's home instantly
- 🌐 **Web dashboard** - Beautiful, responsive interface
- 📺 **TV display mode** - Full-screen view perfect for wall-mounted displays
- 🎨 **Color-coded devices** - Each person gets a unique color
- ✏️ **Device editing** - Change nicknames and colors after setup
- 📸 **Profile pictures** - Upload custom photos or use default emoji
- 🔍 **Multiple discovery methods** - Ping, ARP ping, and more
- ⚙️ **Configurable settings** - Scan intervals, network ranges, timeouts
- 📱 **Device management** - Add/remove devices, set nicknames
- 🔐 **Authentication** - Secure login system
- 📊 **Real-time updates** - Live status updates via WebSocket
- 💾 **SQLite database** - Persistent storage for all settings
- 🌍 **Universal compatibility** - Works on any Linux system

## How It Works

The application uses various network discovery methods to detect devices:

1. **Ping (ICMP)** - Fast and reliable for most devices
2. **ARP Ping** - Works even when devices block ICMP
3. **ARP Table Lookup** - Checks system ARP cache

You can track devices by their MAC addresses and assign friendly nicknames and colors for easy identification.

## Quick Start

### Installation

For any Linux computer on your LAN (Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whos-home.git
cd whos-home
sudo ./install.sh
```

> **Note**: Replace `yourusername` with the actual GitHub username when publishing.



### Post-Installation

1. Access the web interface at `http://your-device-ip:5000`
2. Login with default credentials: `admin` / `admin`
3. **Change the password immediately!**
4. Configure your network range in Settings if auto-detection is wrong
5. Click "Add Device" to discover and start tracking devices
6. For TV display: Click "TV Display" or visit `/tv` for full-screen mode

### Manual Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL/Fedora)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Root or sudo access

#### Install Dependencies

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv git sqlite3 iputils-ping net-tools arping
```

**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip git sqlite iputils net-tools arping
```

#### Setup Application

1. Clone and setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whos-home.git
cd whos-home
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create data directory:
```bash
mkdir data
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Access at `http://localhost:5000`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=5000
DATABASE_PATH=data/whos_home.db
```

### Discovery Settings

Configure through the web interface:

- **Scan Interval**: How often to check device status (10-300 seconds)
- **Network Range**: IP range to scan (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24` or `auto`)
- **Discovery Methods**: Choose between ping, arping, or both
- **Timeouts**: Adjust for your network conditions

### Database

The application uses SQLite with automatic schema creation. The database stores:

- User accounts
- Tracked devices (MAC, nickname, color)
- Discovery settings
- Discovery logs for debugging

## Usage

### Adding Devices

1. Click "Add Device" on the dashboard
2. Run network discovery to find devices
3. Select devices to track and assign nicknames
4. Choose colors for easy identification

### Managing Devices

- **Add**: Discover devices on your network and add them to tracking
- **Edit**: Change device nicknames, colors, and profile pictures
- **Pictures**: Upload custom photos or remove to use default 👤 emoji
- **Remove**: Stop tracking a device
- **Status**: View online/offline status and last seen time
- **Colors**: Each device gets a unique color for easy identification

### Settings

Access via the gear icon in the dashboard:

- **Scan Interval**: How often to check device status (10-300 seconds)
- **Network Range**: IP range to scan (auto-detected or manual)
- **Discovery Methods**: Choose ping, ARP ping, or both
- **Timeouts**: Adjust ping and ARP timeouts for your network

### TV Display Mode

Perfect for wall-mounted displays or tablets:

- **Full-screen layout** optimized for viewing from a distance
- **Dynamic columns** - one per person currently home
- **Real-time updates** - automatically refreshes as people come/go
- **Color-coded** - each person shown in their chosen color
- **Smart text contrast** - readable on any background color
- **Access**: Click "TV Display" in navigation or visit `/tv`

## Service Management

```bash
# Service management (works on all systems)
sudo whos-home-start
sudo whos-home-stop
sudo whos-home-status

# View logs
tail -f /var/log/whos-home.log

# If systemd is available, you can also use:
sudo systemctl start whos-home
sudo systemctl stop whos-home
sudo systemctl status whos-home
```

## Hardware Requirements

**Any Linux computer directly connected to your LAN:**

- Raspberry Pi (any model) - Perfect for dedicated use
- Desktop PC with Linux
- Laptop with Linux  
- Mini PC/NUC
- Old computer repurposed with Linux
- Any device with Ethernet or WiFi connection to your network

**Network requirements:**
- Must be on the same LAN as devices you want to track
- Needs network scanning capabilities (ping, ARP)
- For best MAC detection: direct network access (not virtualized)

**Supported Linux distributions:**
- Ubuntu/Debian (apt)
- CentOS/RHEL/Fedora (dnf/yum)
- Arch Linux (pacman)
- openSUSE (zypper)
- Any distribution with Python 3.7+

## Security Considerations

1. **Change default password** immediately after installation
2. **Use HTTPS** in production (Raspberry Pi installer includes nginx)
3. **Firewall**: Only allow access from trusted networks
4. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **Network access**: The service needs raw network access for best MAC detection
6. **Placement**: Install on a device with direct network access (not virtualized)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service won't start:**
```bash
# Check status and logs
sudo whos-home-status
tail -f /var/log/whos-home.log

# Check permissions
sudo chown -R whos-home:whos-home /opt/whos-home
```

**No devices found:**
- Check network range settings match your LAN
- Ensure devices are powered on and connected
- Try different discovery methods in settings

**MAC addresses show "Unknown":**
- Normal on some networks, devices will still be tracked by IP
- Ensure the computer is on the same LAN segment

### Database Issues

Reset database (will lose all data):
```bash
sudo systemctl stop whos-home
sudo rm /opt/whos-home/data/whos_home.db
sudo systemctl start whos-home
```
